# THE LOVERS 

In this lab, you will exploit a classic SQL Injection vulnerability to access the admin panel of a dating app. From there, you will obtain sensitive credentials and progress to uncover hidden relationships, secret directories, and privileged users. In this lab, you will learn:

- Identification and exploitation of SQL Injection in login forms
- Remote access to Linux servers via SSH
- Searching for sensitive information in user profiles
- Cracking hashes with tools like `hashcat`
- Privilege escalation based on users with root permissions
